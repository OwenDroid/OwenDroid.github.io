        <p id="b52">The B-52 Stratofortress (BUFF) is the oldest plane still in service with the US Air Force
            beating only the C-130 by one year. The B-52 was used extensively during the Cold War there were a number of
            B-52 were constantly in the air so if
            the Soviet Union were to launch a nuclear attack the US would send these B-52 to the Soviet Union
            immediately as a retaliatory effort. This caused the B-52 to be under
            much stress and caused it to have a lot of maintenance issues such as some B-52s falling apart mid-air and
            consequently causing nuclear bombs being dropped onto US soil.
            The B-52's current mission in the Air Force is to use its bomb bay as a launch bay for multiple cruise
            missiles instead of doing conventional bombing missions. It has a 185 ft wingspan and is 159ft in length
            maximum payload weight is 70,000 lb of mixed ordnance, bombs, mines, and missiles. Its range is 8,800
            miles with a service ceiling of
            50,000ft.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
