        <p id="first">Welcome to the about me portion of my website this section will include some brief information on my hobbies,
            some of the things I have done during my time in school, and some other information regarding computers such
            as ones I&#39ve worked on, and my personal computer. One of the things that interest me most is aviation,
            more specifically military aviation. I also enjoy playing video games in my off time
            most recently Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War and Fortnite with my friends.</p>

        <p id="second">Throughout middle school and high school, I participated in the band program. In middle school, it was all a
            concert band where we would practice music and then play it for a concert. After middle school and in high
            school I joined the marching band where I marched trombone.
            Marching band can be very tiring but also rewarding at the same time. My school marching band has done well
            in the four years I&#39ve done it my freshman year we placed highly in the finales at Bands of America
            Regionals at Welcome Stadium in Dayton, Ohio. In my sophomore year, we got the highest score we had ever gotten at the
            BOA Super Regionals in Indianapolis. This year we again made it to finals at the BOA Regional this time in
            Obetz, Ohio this time placing 7th.</p>

        <p id="third"> I have had a strong interest in computers since I started playing video games it mostly started with me
            wanting to mod Minecraft and try to make some other games. In my freshman year, I took the IT CTC Intro
            class where I “built” a computer with some of the other students in that class it was a motherboard without
            a case with a either Pentium or Celeron processor and it was running Ubuntu as the operating system we tried
            to download windows 7 on it but that didn't work. When I took the actual CTC class in my junior and senior
            years I reapplied thermal paste and installed windows on the computers we used the junior year and I built
            two of the 24 computers for the engineering CTC and esports team. My
            computer at home is a Lenovo Legion S7 laptop which has an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU, 16GB DDR4 4800 MT/s RAM,
            1TB SSD and a 5TB external hard drive, and an AMD Radeon RX 6800S GPU.</p>
