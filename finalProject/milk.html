            I have gone through a lot of different music tastes when I was younger still in elementary school I liked
            pop music or whatever was on the radio at the time because I rarely ever listened to music otherwise. During
            middle school I started playing the trombone so I started listening to classical music and video game
            soundtracks this is also when I started listening to music on Spotify instead of using YouTube. When I
            started high school I still listened to video game music more specifically Halo music during this time I
            made many playlists on Spotify such as one where I manually put all of the sequel trilogy of Star Wars and
            another with every Star Wars movie soundtrack put into one playlist. I've also made a Halo playlist that
            combines all of the mainline Halo game soundtracks into one playlist. During my Junior year, I started
            listening to rock music mainly starting with random songs and then letting Spotify go on recommended songs
            after that song was over I made one of the playlists that are featured on this page the 'rock' playlist
            with songs that I liked and has grown since with the most recent additions being Metallica and
            Linkin Park. I have also made a playlist that is 36.5 hours long and has 591 songs and was made by combining
            the
            Ace Combat 7 soundtrack, the Project Wingman soundtrack, my rock playlist, my 16-hour Halo playlist, my
            complete Minecraft playlist, the God of War Ragnarok soundtrack and a few other random songs mixed in as
            well.
