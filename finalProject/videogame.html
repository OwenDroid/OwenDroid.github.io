                        covenant war that takes place across all of Halo 1, 2, and 3</td>
                    <td>7/10<br /> Haven't played much of the multiplayer but what I have played
                        it was enjoyable although I was not very good due to it being my first time playing it</td>
                    <td>10/10<br />Halo Reach has some of the best music of all the Halo games some other
                        Halo games with good music include Halo 2 Anniversary and Halo 3 ODST</td>
                    <td>6/10<br />Featurs have a pretty good amount of weapons and vehicles but lacks some of the
                        weapons seen in the other games such as the battle rifle</td>
                    <td>N/A<br />Game no longer gets updates except for small updates on MCC due to it being
                        released on the Xbox 360</td>

                    </td>
                    <td>6/10<br />Playing actual multiplayer is a headache as there are just insanely good players
                        but playing Frontier Defence which is the CO-OP mode is very enjoyable </td>
                    <td>8/10<br />Music has some good songs but most of them are nothing amazing and are just used to
                        build suspence</td>
                    <td>7/10<br />Features a large number of weapons, titans, and other upgrades for your character and
                        other customization</td>

                        and
                        has since been sunset by EA</td>

                    <th>Fortnite</th>
                    <td>5/10<br />The Save The World mode has a long campaign that has some enjoyable moments but a lot
                        of the missions are just
                        fetch quest that can sometimes take too long to do</td>
                    <td>8/10<br />The game's main mode is Battle Royale so it has pretty decent multiplayer but it has
                        some issues with
                        balancing of weapons and matchmaking </td>
                    <td>4/10<br />Has some good music such as Spies form Ch2S2 and Coral Chorus from Ch1S8 but most of
                        these lobby musics have to be unlocked
                        in some way or are no longer uptenable</td>
                    <td>9/10<br />Features a large variety of weapons that will change out every once and a while but
                        most are always available in the Creative mode which makes for a very large sandbox of weapons
                    </td>
                    <td>10/10<br />Has content updates almost weekly most updates feature new things albeit most
                        being skins or other cosmetic items</td>

                    <th>Battlefield V</th>
                    <td>3/10<br />The campaign was good gameplay and storytelling wise but the game is set in WWII and
                        the campaign doesn't feature any of the numerous
                        amounts of well-known battles such as D-Day in the campaign</td>
                    <td>8/10<br />Like most Battlefield games the multiplayer is very fun and chaotic the maps are some
                        what is balanced for each team and which team is winning can change in an instant</td>
                    <td>7/10<br />The music is good and builds up to make a climatic ending to a game</td>
                    <td>6/10<br />Features a large number of weapons and vehicles that are all the most historically
                        accurate
                        besides being able to play as the Germans with an M1 Garand</td>
                    <td>N/A<br />Much like Titanfall 2 this game was released on the Xbox One and PS4 but I did not play
                        at the time it had updates and EA has since
                        ceased development on the game and moved to different projects</td>

                    <td>9/10<br />Has some questionable moments in the campaign but most of the campaign is fairly good
                        and enjoyable to play</td>
                    <td>4/10<br />Not very good multiplayer it doesn't have very good matchmaking and it doesn't help
                        that
                        not a lot of people play it even at peak times during the week</td>
                    <td>10/10<br />The music in this game is amazing and once it was released on Spotify it was the only
                        the thing I listened to for at least 2 weeks</td>
                    <td>8/10<br />Features a decent amount of planes to use but it is missing some planes that would be
                        nice to also include such as the AJ-37 Viggen of the F-111 Ardvark</td>
                    <td>4/10<br />Only really had one major update during its lifetime and it was for when Top Gun
                        Maverick realesed other than that most updates were just bug or balance fixes</td>

                    <td>7/10<br />Can have pretty quick matchmaking times but has some major balancing issues</td>
                    <td>5/10<br />Some pretty good background music that doesn't distract too much but can also get
                    repetitive due to only a select few amount of songs</td>
                    <td>10/10<br />Features a large number of vehicles for every tech tree in the game for air, ground
                    and some sea tech trees for some countries </td>
                    <td>6/10<br />Has somewhat frequent updates about 4-5 major updates a year which in each update
                    includes many new vehicles for trees in the most recent update they are adding the F-117, F-15E
                    and Su-34 and new major vehicles in the past these major updates have also included full tech
